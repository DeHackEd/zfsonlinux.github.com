<p>The <a href="http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php/Main_Page">Lustre</a> Orion
development branch is a version of the code which has been architected to
support multiple backend filesystems.  This work was originally started at
Sun, continued at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/
storage/storage-software/031855.htm">Oracle</a>, and now has been taken over
by <a href="http://whamcloud.com/">Whamcloud</a>.  Despite these disruptions
<a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/">Livermore</a> has remained involved
in the development and committed to deploying a <a href="llnl-zfs-lustre.html">
zfs based Lustre solution</a> for our large Linux clusters.</p>

<p>The focus of the work at <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/">
Livermore</a> has been to port zfs to the Linux kernel so it may be used
as an advanced backend filesystem for Lustre.  While ldiskfs has served
Lustre well there is growing acceptence that ldiskfs will soon no longer
be a viable solution for the largest Lustre filesystems.  The
<a href="http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php/ZFS_and_Lustre">limitations of
ldiskfs</a> are well known and allowing alternate backend filesystems,
like zfs, is clearly a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Support for multiple backend filesystem was accomplished by developing a
common interface used by Lustre to communicate with the backend filesystem.
This interface cleanly abstracts away any filesystem specific details from
the higher layers of Lustre.  Lustre then provides a small filesystem specific
layer called the osd which contains the needed filesystem specific code.
The ldiskfs osd was added first and it was soon followed by the zfs osd.
There is considerable interest in adding a btrfs osd but this work has
not yet begun.</p>

<p>The Lustre Orion branch is not yet complete and is still under active
development.  It is not currently suitable for production use but it is
available for testing.  The current development is being done under RHEL6
and for the moment you are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to use RHEL6.
Alternately, you could use a recent Fedora release with a 2.6.32 based
kernel.  Other Linux distributions/kernels are unlikely to work at the
current time.</p>
