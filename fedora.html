<p>DKMS style packages for Fedora are available from the zfsonlinux.org 
repository.  These packages track the latest official upstream tag and
are refreshed as new releases are made available.  Packages are provided
for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Releases: 18, 19, 20, 21</li>
	<li>Arches: x86_64</li>
</ul>

<p>To add the repository to your system install the <b>zfs-release</b>
package as shown below.  This will add the <b>/etc/yum.repo.d/zfs.repo</b>
file and required signing keys to your system.  You can now install zfs like
any other Fedora package using yum.  As new updated packages are made
available they will be detected and installed as part of the standard
update process.</p>

<p>In addition to the primary <b>zfs</b> repository a <b>zfs-testing</b>
repository is available.  This repository, which is disabled by default,
contains the latest versions of zfs which are under active development.
These packages are made available in order to get feedback from testers
regarding the functionality and stability of upcoming releases.  These
packages <b>should not</b> be used on production systems.  Packages from
the testing repository can be installed as follows.</p>
