<dd>
The pool contains an on-disk format incompatibility.  Affected pools must be
imported and scrubbed using the current version of ZFS.  This will return the
pool to a state in which it may be imported by other implementations.  This
errata only impacts compatibility between ZFS versions, no user data is at
risk as result of this erratum.

<pre>
# zpool status -x
  pool: test
 state: ONLINE
status: Errata #1 detected.
action: To correct the issue run 'zpool scrub'.

<p>
<dl>
<dt><p><b>Type</b>
<dd>Compatibility
<dt><p><b>Severity</b>
<dd>Moderate
<dt><p><b>Description</b>
<dd>The ZFS packages were updated while an asynchronous destroy was in
progress and the pool contains an on-disk format incompatibility.
<dt><p><b>Automated Response</b>
<dd>No automated response will be taken.
<dt><p><b>Impact</b>
<dd>The pool cannot be imported until the issue is corrected.
<dt><p><b>Suggested Action for System Administrator</b>
<dd>
Affected pools must be reverted to the previous ZFS version where they can
be correctly imported.  Once imported all asynchronous destroy operations
must be allowed to complete.  The ZFS packages may then be updated and the
pool can be imported cleanly by the newer software.
<pre>
# zpool import
  pool: test
    id: 1165955789558693437
 state: ONLINE
status: Errata #2 detected.
action: The pool cannot be imported with this version of ZFS due to
	an active asynchronous destroy.  Revert to an earlier version
	and allow the destroy to complete before updating.
   see: http://zfsonlinux.org/msg/ZFS-8000-ER
config:

	test           ONLINE
	  raidz1-0     ONLINE
	    vdev0      ONLINE
	    vdev1      ONLINE
	    vdev2      ONLINE
	    vdev3      ONLINE
</pre>

Revert to previous ZFS version, import the pool, then wait for the
<b>freeing</b> property to drop to zero.  This indicates that all outstanding
asynchronous destroys have completed.

<pre>
# zpool get freeing
NAME   PROPERTY  VALUE    SOURCE
rpool  freeing   0        default
</pre>

The ZFS packages may be now be updated and the pool imported.  The on-disk
format incompatibility can now be corrected online as described in
<a href="#1">Errata #1</a>.
